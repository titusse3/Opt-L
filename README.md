  | Short representation | Long representation |
  | :---: | :---: |
  | Beging by the character ```-```, is defined by a single character. |  Beging by the sequence ```--```, is defined by a sequence of characters. |
 

* Short and long option can need argument.

  > space. In contrary, for the long one, the separator can be change on the interface. By default,

  it (a prefix is ambiguous if he is a prefix of at least two option). Example just below : 

  > **Example** 
  > ```--help``` is equivalent to the call ```--h```, ```--he```, ```--hel``` is there 
  > isn't any option that have ```h```, ```he``` or ```hel``` for prefixe.
